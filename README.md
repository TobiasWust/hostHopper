# HostHopper

**HostHopper** is a Chrome extension designed for developers who need to quickly switch between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) while maintaining the same path. With HostHopper, you can group hosts into sets and effortlessly hop between them, making testing and comparing environments easier and faster.
